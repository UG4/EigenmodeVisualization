# EigenmodeVisualization

This project is intended to visualize oscillation patterns of 3d objects.

Functionality to visually investigate defects in several steps of computations
is included in its basic idea and might be moved to another project at a later
time.

The implementation is based on Sebastian Reiter's ProMesh3d and uses the 
GUI as well as the 3d animation of unstructured grids.
